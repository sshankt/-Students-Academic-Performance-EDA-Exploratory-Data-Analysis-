# 🎓 Students Academic Performance EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
### 📘 Project Overview

This project explores the Students Academic Performance Dataset using Python.
The main goal of this analysis is to understand how different factors such as gender, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation influence students’ academic performance across various subjects.

The project covers the complete EDA process — from data loading and cleaning to visualization and insight generation.

## 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains student-level information related to demographics, parental education, and test performance.

Column Name	Description
gender	Gender of the student (male/female)
group	Group category (A, B, C, etc.)
parental level of education	Highest education level of the student’s parents
lunch	Type of lunch (standard or free/reduced)
test preparation course	Whether the student completed the test prep course
math score	Student’s math score
reading score	Student’s reading score
writing score	Student’s writing score
avg_score	Average of math, reading, and writing scores

## 📈 Key Insights


Female students (52%) slightly outnumber males (48%).

Group C has the most students, while Group A has the least.

Students whose parents hold bachelor’s or master’s degrees tend to perform better.

Students with a standard lunch score higher than those with free/reduced lunch, showing how economic stability impacts learning.

Girls outperform in reading and writing, while boys excel in math.

Students who completed the test preparation course scored significantly higher, showing the impact of academic preparation.


## 🧾 Conclusion

Student performance is influenced by a combination of gender, parental education, economic background, and academic preparation.
Providing equal educational resources, good nutrition, and access to support programs can help all students reach their full potential.

💡 Learning Outcomes

Developing skills in data cleaning, visualization, and storytelling


## Overall Discription

From this analysis of the Student Academic Performance dataset, we can see some clear patterns. Student results are affected by a mix of personal, social, and family factors. The number of boys and girls is almost equal, but boys usually score higher in math, while girls do better in reading and writing.

Family background also matters — students whose parents have higher education levels, like a bachelor’s or master’s degree, tend to score better. Those who get a standard lunch also perform better than students with free or reduced lunch, showing that family income and nutrition can impact learning.

Students who completed the test preparation course scored higher as well, proving that extra study support really helps.

Overall, student performance depends on gender, parental education, economic background, and academic support, and improving these areas can help every student do their best.
